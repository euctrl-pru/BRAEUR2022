OpenAP: https://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/openap/

The aircraft data is located in a project subfolder, i.e. openap/data/aircraft.

openap/data/aircraft/a19n.yml

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/openap/data/aircraft/"

# check what we have
acs <- list.files(path = url
                  #, pattern = "\\.yml"
                  , full.names = TRUE)
```

rq <- rvest::read_html(url) %>% rvest::html_nodes("a") %>% rvest::html_text() %>% as_tibble()
rq %>% filter(grepl(pattern = "\\.yml", x = value))
